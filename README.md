Analyzing stocks data using VBA
## Resualts
* Analyzing stocks data using VBA I want to present  the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock in this analysis. Daily volume is the total number of shares traded throughout the day; it measures how actively a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.Looking at the data, we will concentrate on two results, the total returns for the years 2017 and 2018 and the execution times for the performance of the VBA code (orgininal code vs. refacoted).Comparing stocks returns for the year 2017 vs 2018 year we can conclude that our stock portfolio (consisted of green energy stocks) was out performing in 2017, compared to 2018. In 2017 we had 11 stocks making positive returns, some making almost 200 % return for the following year ("DQ" 2017=199.4% return). On the other hand 2018 was a year with low, negative returns (only two stocks had positive returns for the year "ENPH" and "RUN"). Taking into consideration volume of traded stocks we can see  trading activity drop in 2018. Number of positive returns in 2017 suggest that 2017 was a great "bull run" for green energy stocks ( "Bull markets" occur when there is a sustained rise in stock prices, and they are typically accompanied by elevated consumer confidence, low unemployment, and strong economic growth.) Considering 2018 returns we can conclude that investing in green energy stocks wasn't a lucrative investment. If we focus our attention on individual stocks "DQ" might not be a good overall pick considering both years, compared to "ENPH" stock.
Measuring code run times  (2017 original code time of 0,6171875 sec vs 2017 refactored code time of 0.1328125 secand 2018 original code time of 0.5859375 sec vs 0.09375 sec) we can conclude that refactoring code speed up our code performance.
